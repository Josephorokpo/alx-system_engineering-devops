0x0E. Web stack debugging #1

***ALX Software Engineering Programme Project***

This marked the second installment in a sequence of web stack debugging projects. Within these assignments, malfunctioning web stacks were provided within isolated containers, challenging me to restore them to a functional state. For each assignment, I devised a script to automate the required commands for rectifying the issues with the web stack.
