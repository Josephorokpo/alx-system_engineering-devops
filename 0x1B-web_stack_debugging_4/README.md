#0x1B. Web stack debugging #4

***ALX Software Engineering Programme Project***


This is another task within a series of web stack debugging projects. In each instance, I encountered malfunctioning or flawed web stacks confined within isolated containers, and my objective was to rectify them to a working condition. For every task, I crafted scripts aimed at automating the troubleshooting steps needed to address and resolve the issues present in the web stack.

#Tasks

0. Sky is the limit, let's bring that limit higher

0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp: Puppet manifest that increases the amount of traffic an Apache web server can effectively handle.

1. User limit
