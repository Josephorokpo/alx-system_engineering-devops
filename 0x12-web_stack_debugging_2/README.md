0x12. Web stack debugging #2

***ALX Software Engineering Programme Project***

This project was part of a series focused on debugging web stacks. Within this series, I encountered malfunctioning web stacks contained within isolated environments. My objective was to rectify these issues and restore the web stack to a functional state. To streamline the process, I developed scripts for each task, automating the steps required to resolve the problems.
